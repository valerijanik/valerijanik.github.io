                                <h3>My first work place at a professional game company</h3>
                                <p>
                                    My last work place has been at Next Games, a mobile game company, developing
                                    games based on franchise entertainment. I was lucky to become one of the
                                    students of Next Games Academy, that started in October 2019.
                                    <br><br>
                                    First two months we've been introduced to the industry as a whole and Next
                                    Games itself, how the company works, what Tech the company uses and why, had
                                    lectures and talks by amazing developers, artists, testers, designers and
                                    producers of the company about the ways of working at Next Games. We have
                                    learned about the development and the work flow of games companies.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Next four months I've been lucky to be working on the game project, that I was
                                    extremely excited - game based on Netflix's series Stranger Things. The team of
                                    amazing professionals, who were always ready to talk, explain and help. During
                                    this time I've developed several features that we now in the game. I've learned
                                    Git more deeply, learned about design and programming as a whole, the process of
                                    game development and publishing.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This six months of my time at Next Games I've became a proper Junior Game Developer,
                                    who has faced many issues, was able to solve them, who can develop features
                                    independently, who was able to look at who systems and add features on top on them.
