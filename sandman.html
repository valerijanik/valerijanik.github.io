                                <h3>My second School project at Stadin Ammattiopisto</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This was my second game project at Mediastadi (Helsinki, Finland).
                                    During this project I've been a Lead Programmer, who was responsible
                                    for the game being playable and according to the view of the game designer.
                                    I've been working closely with game lead, game designer and lead artist.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The game was based on the story of Sandman (Nukkumatti), who is jumping on
                                    clouds, speaks to pegions and kills nightmares. After the player kills enemies,
                                    there's some loot falling from them that player picks up. There were starts as
                                    currency and extra lives.
                                    <br><br>
                                    During this project I learned the pain and love of my life – animations.
                                    I actually was excited to do them and when I got my hands on them –
                                    that was painful :D But with tears and lots of coffee I've implemented all of them.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Anyways, animations for player and enemies, player, enemies and pigeons movement,
                                    NPCs, camera movement and zoom, shop setup and work, enemies loot, particles.
                                    Implementation of 2D and 3D assets as well as textures.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Also for this project I've done a 3D model of a city below the clouds.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The project itself was quite a mess, but we've tried to organize it as well as we
                                    could. During my summer internship I learned how important it is to keep everything
                                    clean and nice and learned how to do it myself.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This game would never happen without the best teacher and supervisor Seppo Toikka.

                                <h3>Video of the gameplay</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Here is a short video of the first level with a small tutorial of the game. We had three
                                    weapons available and shop was done in 2D style, but at the last moment it was
                                    decided to change it to 3D, what broke the game. Still a learning point, not to change
                                    small things in last two days of development.
                                </p>
